# Risk Assessment Simulation - ISO 27001 Methodology

## Project Overview
**This repository demonstrates a full ISO 27001 risk assessment on a Cyber Threat Intelligence Dashboard, including comprehensive report and risk register.**

This project showcases a comprehensive information security risk assessment conducted on a custom-built Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Dashboard system, following ISO 27001:2022 methodology and NIST Cybersecurity Framework principles.

## What This Project Delivers
- **Comprehensive Risk Assessment Report**: Complete analysis including asset inventory, threat analysis, control framework, and implementation roadmap
- **Risk Register**: Detailed risk matrix with Impact vs. Likelihood assessment and treatment strategies
- **Professional Methodology**: Demonstrates practical application of industry-standard risk management frameworks

## Key Components
- **Asset Inventory**: 35+ assets classified by criticality, confidentiality, and business impact
- **Threat Analysis**: 25 threats analyzed using STRIDE methodology across technical, operational, environmental, and human categories
- **Control Framework**: ISO 27001:2022 control mapping with implementation status and roadmap
- **Risk Treatment**: Strategic recommendations with immediate, short-term, and medium-term action plans

## Professional Value
